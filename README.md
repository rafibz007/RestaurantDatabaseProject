## Description
  The project is about a system supporting the activities of a company that provides catering services to customers
individuals and companies.  


  The offer includes food (e.g. biscuits, lunch, small snacks, rosol) and non-alcoholic drinks (e.g. coffee, cocktails, water).
Services are provided on-site and to take away. A takeaway order can be ordered in the restaurant or
in advance online.  
  The company has a limited number of tables, including seating. It is possible to book in advance
a table for at least two people.  
  The clients are individuals and companies (they receive larger amounts of meals at lunchtime or as catering, without
delivery). It is possible to issue an invoice for a given order or a collective invoice once a month.  
  On Thursday-Friday-Saturday it is possible to order seafood dishes in advance.
Due to individual import, such an order should be placed no later than Monday
preceding the order.  


  The online form allows an individual customer to book a table, with the simultaneous submission
orders, with the option of payment before or after the order, with a minimum order value,
in the case of customers who previously placed at least a certain number of orders. Information along with
confirmation of the order and indication of the table is sent after approval by the service.  


  The system enables the implementation of discount programs for individual customers. Discounts are divided into lifetime and temporary discounts.  

  The system also allows you to generate reports for an individual customer
and companies.
